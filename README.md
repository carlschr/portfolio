# Responsive Portfolio Project

## About the Project

* This portfolio application was built using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap CSS library.

* It consists of three pages: About Me, Portfolio, and Contact.

* The navigation bar was created using the bootstrap "navbar" class.

* The general layout of each page utilized the bootstrap grid system or the flexbox system.

* The footer was the most challenging component for me to get right and I ended up using a sticky footer to get rid of extra white-space bellow the normally positioned footer.

## Project Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
