Currently he has some experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but he will be learning much more throughout his studies. He has always been a lover of puzzles and, as a result, is finding the logical problem-solving inherent to programming to be very enjoyable. Until recently, Chris' focuses were in the field of music performance and education. He has a Bachelor's of Music in Percussion Performance, a Bachelor's of Music in Music Education and is certified to teach music K-12 in the state of Pennsylvania. The creative challenges of music and the management and planning challenges of education will likely prove tremendously helpful in his pursuit of a software engineering career. Chris' earned his Bachelor's degrees at West Chester University of Pennsylvania and has attended one year of graduate schooling at DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois in pursuit of a Master's of Music in Percussion Performance.</p>

Most of the in-class learning will at the surface-level; however, Chris is making use of many online resources to supplement his learning and take a deep dive into each language and topic in order to gain a deeper and more useful understanding of these skills.</p>
